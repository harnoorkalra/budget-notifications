# budget-notifications

Hi everyone, this code basically takes the salary input and allocates a portion of your salary towards your bills, food, misc items and sends you a desktop notification, also reminds you to pay your bills. (Compatible only with MacOS - M1 included)
I have also provided my template of the budgeting sheet from where my code pulls the data. You can use that or make a new one of your own. Don't forget to change the path of the directory in which your budgeting sheet is present!
